# Foreword
This repo was created for anyone curious as to what is going on with Intel GPUs in regards to Stable Diffusion. 

# Current Articles
  * [GIMP Stable Diffusion](https://game.intel.com/us/stories/intel-arc-graphics-stable-diffusion/): Could not get this working but I am not one who works with photo editing software.
  * [GIMP Stable Diffusion Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCK7WPo7PKo): I will look at this at some point in the future.

# Operating System
This repo was put together with my [intel gpu machine](https://github.com/vampireLibrarianMonk/intel-gpu-hello) operating on Ubuntu 22.4.03. 

# Getting Started

2. Install git and python virtual environment:
```bash
sudo apt install git python3-venv -y
```

4. Read through the following [repo](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Installation), then clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic
```

5. Run with the Intel OneAPI XPU:
```bash
cd automatic && ./webui.sh --debug --use-ipex
```

6. Allow software to install.
